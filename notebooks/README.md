### Notebooks

The notebooks in this directory contain plots of all the functions
in `Landscapes.jl` that are two-dimensional functions, or have
two-dimensional versions. The functions are arranged in alphabetical
order, split across different notebooks; (for me, at least, it provides
a better overview if a notebook doesn't have too much content).
